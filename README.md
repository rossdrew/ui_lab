#ui_lab

A Java lab for playing with GUI functionality.  Primarily concerned with writing a tile-based game library which it hopefully will evolve into.

There are two entry points

<b><tt>MapModelTest</tt></b>
Run as a standard Java entry point.  This provides a GUI window with a map with current features (e.g. mini map, slippy, zoom, tile select, grid display)

<b><tt>MapEditor</tt></b>
The current iteration of map editor, with all current features and map editing, loading and saving functioanlity.

<i>Map files are saved as <tt>*.mgd</tt> files defined by <tt>MapGridFile.java</tt>
